## Description
My project consists of an interactive recycling game, in which in the first level there is simply a bin and it rains recyclable waste and you have to pick it up with the bin.


## MVP (DOM - CANVAS)
-The game has a bin wich can that moves horizontally
-The trash falls vertically
-The trash appears from the top of the screen
-The player will score points as he/she picks up trash, 1 item = 1 point.


## Backlog

-I have to add a scoreboard
-Improve the game with colored bins to choose according to the type of trash that falls
